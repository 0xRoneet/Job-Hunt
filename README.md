## Updates about How we Make API Calls ( Using the ngrok module )
# API Call Updates Readme

## Overview

This section provides important updates regarding how API calls are made in our deployment environment. The code snippet below demonstrates the setup for making API calls using FastAPI, ngrok, and uvicorn.

```python
import ngrok
import nest_asyncio
import uvicorn

ngrok_tunnel = ngrok.connect(8000)
print('Public URL:', ngrok_tunnel.public_url)
nest_asyncio.apply()
uvicorn.run(app, port=8000)
```

## Instructions

To successfully make API calls, follow these steps:

1. **Run the FastAPI Notebook**: Ensure that the `fastapi.ipynb` notebook is running. This notebook is crucial for handling API requests. The API will only be accessible while this notebook is actively running on the server.

2. **Issues with AWS Platform**: It's important to note that there were issues with the AWS platform, and, as a result, we decided not to use it for deployment. Even though we generated a valid API endpoint on AWS, the deployment was not utilized. Instead, we are relying on an alternative method using ngrok for the time being.

## FastAPI Module

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It allows us to quickly create robust APIs with automatic interactive documentation.

Make sure to familiarize yourself with the FastAPI documentation for a better understanding of how the API routes and functionality are defined in the `fastapi.ipynb` notebook.

## ngrok Module

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a powerful tool for exposing local servers to the internet. In our deployment, we utilize ngrok to create a secure tunnel to the FastAPI server running on port 8000. The `ngrok.connect(8000)` line in the code establishes this tunnel and provides a public URL that can be used to make API calls externally.

Please keep in mind that the ngrok tunnel is temporary and will be disconnected if the ngrok process is stopped or the server is restarted. Ensure that the FastAPI notebook is running, and the ngrok tunnel is active for uninterrupted API access.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or encounter issues with the API deployment.
